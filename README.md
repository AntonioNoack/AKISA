This is my original attempt at parsing English, creating a knowledge graph from it, and reasoning using it. This was a personal project from ~2014-2016.

Parsing English - mostly works.
Creating a knowledge graph - limited, I think it needs more flexibility.
Reasoning - attempted, but never worked well enough, was too complicated for me, and the knowledge graph was too thin and shallow for anything useful.
